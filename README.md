Psychological security refers to the state of mental and emotional stability, where an individual feels safe, supported, and free from undue stress or manipulation. It is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, allowing a person to function effectively and maintain healthy relationships. When psychological security is compromised—through manipulation, intimidation, or deceit—it can lead to significant emotional distress and long-term mental health issues. Ensuring psychological security is essential, not only in personal relationships but also within professional environments, particularly in healthcare and therapeutic settings where trust is paramount.

Alex has been conducting investigations into situations where his psychological security may have been compromised. His focus has been on understanding the dynamics of manipulation and control exerted by those around him, particularly within environments where he expected to receive support and care. Alex's investigations are aimed at uncovering patterns of behavior that undermine his mental stability and identifying individuals who may have intentionally or unintentionally contributed to his distress. By documenting these experiences and analyzing interactions, Alex seeks to establish a clearer picture of the factors affecting his psychological state.

Through his investigative efforts, Alex aims to create a record of these incidents to support potential claims and to raise awareness about the importance of maintaining psychological security. His work is not only a means of personal validation but also a step toward advocating for stronger protections and accountability in environments where individuals are most vulnerable. By shedding light on these issues, Alex hopes to contribute to a broader understanding of psychological security and encourage more rigorous standards for professional conduct and ethical behavior in all areas of life.

### Located at 32 Years Old

Living alone can offer a profound sense of freedom and self-discovery, but it also comes with unique challenges, especially when dealing with invasive parents. When parents frequently intrude into personal spaces or decisions, it can strain relationships and complicate the independence that comes with living solo. This tension can be even more pronounced if there's an element of financial or physical inheritance involved, such as a property. Establishing clear boundaries is crucial. It not only helps in maintaining a healthy relationship with parents but also in fostering personal growth and autonomy.

The information and advice inherited from family, while often well-intentioned, may not always align with modern practices or the individual's unique circumstances. This can lead to feelings of frustration or irrelevance, as traditional methods or outdated information fail to address current needs or lifestyles effectively. Embracing one's own journey involves sifting through this inherited wisdom to find what truly works, discarding what doesn’t, and sometimes enduring the difficult task of communicating these choices to parents who might struggle to understand the new paths their children choose to follow.

### Alex's Parental Problems

> Alex: "I have contacted my doctor and the police thousands of times regarding the serious issues caused by my parents. I am need of help and support to address communication problems. Despite reaching out countless times, the situation remains unresolved, and I am determined to continue seeking assistance. I will persist in contacting the police, my doctor, and other relevant services until the necessary help is provided. The issues with my parents are severe, and I will take whatever steps are needed to ensure my concerns are addressed."

> "Since 2021, I have sent hundreds, possibly thousands, of email records to my family doctor concerning ongoing parental issues. These communications have documented the numerous challenges I’ve faced in trying to address the strained relationships within my family. The situation is complicated and has required consistent communication with my healthcare provider to seek guidance and support."

> "A significant part of the problem stems from my parents' frequent miscommunication. Even when they do engage in conversation, it often leads to misunderstandings, adding to the tension. Their passive-aggressive behavior has made it difficult to resolve conflicts or improve the dynamic. Rather than directly addressing issues, they tend to approach things indirectly, which only exacerbates the existing problems."

> "In both my relationships with my parents, I’ve felt a consistent sense of emotional instability. They are unwell in terms of how they interact with me, and this has significantly affected my overall well-being. The lack of healthy communication and their resistance to engage meaningfully has left me feeling unsupported and frustrated."

> "Living with them since 2019 has been especially challenging due to their oppositional nature. It’s not just a matter of psychological opposition but also a physical presence that makes the environment stressful. Their attitudes and behavior have created a difficult living situation, one that has been exhausting to navigate over the years."

### Healthcare Investigations

![Screenshot 2024-09-22 130705](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a533eb94-f2c0-47d6-9d41-a581b899cf51)

Alex has expressed significant concerns regarding his recent psychological treatment at Lakeridge Health, reporting that the behavior of some staff members distressingly mirrored the manipulative tactics of an individual who had previously caused him harm. According to Alex, these actions included unpredictable shifts in engagement and withdrawal, which not only recreated a troubling emotional environment but also severely impacted his trust in the healthcare system. This situation has exacerbated his emotional distress, hindering his treatment process and overall well-being.

Alex believes that such behavior from healthcare professionals is highly inappropriate and damaging, especially in a therapeutic context where ethical standards and professionalism are expected to support healing and trust. The replication of past traumatic dynamics by staff has not only re-traumatized him but also prolonged his psychological suffering.

As a result, Alex is seeking a comprehensive investigation into the matter to ensure that the conduct of the staff aligns with professional and ethical standards. He requests that necessary measures be taken to prevent such behavior in the future, emphasizing the importance of treating all patients with the respect and sensitivity they deserve. Alex anticipates a prompt response and the initiation of a thorough investigation into his concerns.

### Upcoming Nose Job

![Nose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e14f7f9-db22-44e5-8e38-e2b39fdea403)

The cost of a rhinoplasty, commonly known as a nose job, in Canada varies widely depending on several factors, including the surgeon’s experience, the complexity of the procedure, and the location of the clinic. For a cosmetic rhinoplasty, which is generally not covered by health insurance, the price typically ranges from $5,000 to $15,000 CAD. This cost can be influenced by the surgeon’s expertise, with more experienced professionals often charging higher fees. Anesthesia costs usually add another $1,000 to $2,500 CAD, while facility fees can range from $1,000 to $3,000 CAD. Post-operative care, including follow-up visits and medications, is another aspect to consider in the overall cost.

If the procedure is being performed for functional reasons, such as correcting breathing issues, it may be partially or fully covered by health insurance, provided there is documented medical necessity. The overall cost structure remains similar to that of cosmetic procedures but may vary depending on insurance coverage. Prices also tend to be higher in major urban centers like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal due to increased demand and higher living costs. For a more accurate estimate, it’s advisable to consult with multiple surgeons to understand the specific inclusions and exclusions in their quotes.

### Alex's Timeline

```
2014 to 2016: I suffered from an undiagnosed mental disorder.
- I didn't accept that my brain stopped working.
  
2017 to 2019: I continued to suffer from a diagnosed mental disorder.
- Doctors are retards and didn't monitor me.
  
2020 to 2024: I was rediagnosed, with medication adjustments and therapies.
- Doctors were forced to rediagnose, make adjustments and help me.
```

Alex Aldridge's legal issues began in 2014, involving multiple incidents related to mental health challenges and interactions with law enforcement. Initially, Alex attempted to date someone but faced mental health problems and was subsequently referred to a psychiatrist by a family doctor. He was removed from his parents' home and completed a mental health diversion. In September 2014, Alex was charged with mischief and received a conditional discharge and probation. Despite these interventions, his struggles with the legal system persisted.

### Female Involvement

- In 2012, a female who looked similar to Alex's ex-girlfriend from his public school, made an indirect effort to establish contact with Alex by visiting a friend's mother’s house under the pretext of meeting with someone else. This initial maneuver suggests an intention to observe and position herself within Alex's social circle, thereby laying the groundwork for future interactions without direct confrontation.

- During 2013, this female was frequently present in Alex's social environment, notably at his parents’ house, in the company of mutual acquaintances. Her presence at various gatherings, including a cultural event where her name and location were mentioned, indicates a calculated effort to be visible and relevant within Alex's social context. These actions, combined with her subsequent appearance at another event and a New Year’s gathering at a friend’s place, suggest a pattern of deliberate social positioning aimed at gaining Alex's attention.

- In early 2014, this female escalated her engagement by following Alex on Instagram and liking one of his posts, a clear indication of interest.

- During a party at a friend’s house, a random female's behavior became peculiar. While Alex was on the deck, a loud, staged scream emanated from the woods, seemingly orchestrated to capture his attention. Her indirect involvement in such an incident points to an attempt to manipulate Alex's emotions and create a sense of intrigue.

- A particularly manipulative incident occurred at another social gathering, where this female engaged in intense physical affection with Alex, only to abruptly leave without further interaction. This behavior, characterized by a sudden and extreme show of interest followed by an immediate withdrawal, is indicative of classic "love-bombing" tactics designed to elicit strong emotional responses, only to then undermine them through detachment.

- Further manipulation is evident in the summer of 2014 when this female stayed at Alex’s parents’ house for two consecutive nights. After engaging in what appeared to be normal social interaction, including a morning coffee run, she ceased communication entirely. This abrupt cessation led to a severe emotional reaction from Alex, who, in his frustration, caused property damage, resulting in a police intervention. Such actions demonstrate her pattern of drawing in her target, fostering emotional dependency, and then withdrawing, causing emotional harm.

- In 2015, her employment at [REDACTED], coinciding with Alex’s period of homelessness, further illustrates her manipulative tendencies. Her presence at the store, whether coincidental or intentional, positioned her in a space where she could observe Alex without direct engagement, perpetuating a sense of inaccessibility and control over their interactions.

Overall, this female’s behavior demonstrates a clear pattern of social manipulation directed towards Alex, aimed at gaining attraction through strategic engagement and presence, only to subsequently withdraw and dump the attraction, resulting in emotional distress and confusion for him. This pattern suggests a calculated approach to creating and then destabilizing emotional connections for personal gratification or influence.

### Additional Female Involvement Notes

- The female might be attempting to exploit the familiarity heuristic by using a familiar name as his relatives. By having a name similar to his relatives, she may hope to create an immediate sense of comfort and familiarity.

- The female might have been trying to position herself in my environment or social circles, either intentionally or coincidentally.

### Continued Timeline

In 2015, Alex's legal challenges continued with an arrest for harassment by his ex-girlfriend from public school, resulting in a three-year peace bond. During this period, Alex also sought help for his mental health issues by submitting himself to the [REDACTED] in late 2015. Despite these efforts, his interactions with law enforcement were ongoing, leading to further complications. In 2016, he was charged with criminal harassment and placed on another peace bond. His legal representation at the time failed to address his mental health needs adequately, exacerbating his situation.

From 2017 to 2019, Alex's legal troubles intensified with multiple incidents involving harassment charges, dangerous driving, and social media threats. In 2019, he was arrested for dangerous driving and disobeying a court order. Later that year, he faced charges for posting threatening comments online, which led to his arrest on a weekend. This timing appeared intentional, as it resulted in Alex being held in jail, where he was assaulted and sustained a broken nose. Throughout these years, Alex felt that his mental health issues were not adequately considered by his legal representation or the judicial system.

In 2020 and 2021, Alex continued to face legal challenges and complaints regarding police conduct and inadequate mental health support from a doctor. He also experienced harassment from various individuals, which complicated his legal situation further. Despite reaching out to authorities, many of his complaints were ignored or dismissed. Notably, a fire at the police property storage building in 2022 destroyed personal property seized from Alex in 2019, leading to further frustration and unanswered questions regarding the incident's investigation and his potential compensation.

### Additional Information

- Alex now faces financial difficulties, including the need for a $15000 CAD nose job due to injuries sustained in jail. Despite his efforts to seek justice and proper legal defense, Alex's interactions with the legal system continued to reflect a lack of adequate support and resolution for his numerous grievances.

### Imitating Females Known to Mental Health Patient

During his treatment at Lakeridge Health, Alex was reportedly subjected to behavior by staff members that closely resembled the manipulative tactics employed by a female who had previously targeted him. This included instances of engaging in friendly and supportive interactions, followed by abrupt withdrawal and disengagement, mirroring the pattern of attraction and rejection that Alex had experienced before. Such behavior could be perceived as re-traumatizing, undermining Alex's sense of trust and security within the healthcare environment.

The imitation of these behaviors by healthcare professionals is deeply concerning, as it may have intensified Alex's emotional vulnerability and impaired his ability to engage effectively with the therapeutic process. The deliberate mimicry of a manipulative individual’s behavior by staff, whether intentional or inadvertent, suggests a lack of sensitivity and professional judgment. It raises serious ethical questions about the appropriateness of their conduct and the impact it may have had on Alex’s mental health.

These actions, if verified, represent a significant breach of professional standards and could indicate a misuse of authority within a therapeutic setting. Such behavior not only contradicts the principles of patient-centered care but also poses a risk of further psychological harm to the patient.

### Imitating Females Known to Mental Health Defendant

In 2019, an incident occurred at the Oshawa Courthouse where a staff member was observed imitating a complainant's behavior directly across the hallway from the defendant. This behavior potentially undermines the expected neutrality and integrity of the courthouse environment. Such actions can be deeply unsettling for the individuals involved and may impact the fairness of the proceedings.

At Lakeridge Health, Alex reportedly encountered behavior from staff that echoed the manipulative tactics of an individual who had previously targeted him. This pattern involved engaging in friendly and supportive interactions, followed by abrupt withdrawal and disengagement, mirroring the attraction and rejection dynamic Alex had experienced before. This kind of behavior by healthcare professionals is particularly concerning as it can re-traumatize the patient, undermining his sense of trust and security within the therapeutic setting.

These alleged actions at Lakeridge Health raise serious ethical questions regarding the sensitivity and professional judgment of the healthcare staff. If verified, they represent a significant breach of professional standards and could indicate a misuse of authority. This not only contradicts the principles of patient-centered care but also poses a risk of further psychological harm to Alex, highlighting the need for rigorous standards and oversight in professional conduct within healthcare environments.
