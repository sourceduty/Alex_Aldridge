- I didn't accept that my brain stopped working.
  
2017 to 2019: I continued to suffer from a diagnosed mental disorder.
- Doctors are retards and didn't monitor me.
  
2020 to 2024: I was rediagnosed, with medication adjustments and therapies.
- Doctors were forced to rediagnose, make adjustments and help me.

Alex Aldridge's legal issues began in 2014, involving multiple incidents related to mental health challenges and interactions with law enforcement. Initially, Alex attempted to date someone but faced mental health problems and was subsequently referred to a psychiatrist by a family doctor. He was removed from his parents' home and completed a mental health diversion. In September 2014, Alex was charged with mischief and received a conditional discharge and probation. Despite these interventions, his struggles with the legal system persisted.

### Female Involvement

- In 2012, a female who looked similar to Alex's ex-girlfriend from his public school, made an indirect effort to establish contact with Alex by visiting a friend's mother’s house under the pretext of meeting with someone else. This initial maneuver suggests an intention to observe and position herself within Alex's social circle, thereby laying the groundwork for future interactions without direct confrontation.

- During 2013, this female was frequently present in Alex's social environment, notably at his parents’ house, in the company of mutual acquaintances. Her presence at various gatherings, including a cultural event where her name and location were mentioned, indicates a calculated effort to be visible and relevant within Alex's social context. These actions, combined with her subsequent appearance at another event and a New Year’s gathering at a friend’s place, suggest a pattern of deliberate social positioning aimed at gaining Alex's attention.

- In early 2014, this female escalated her engagement by following Alex on Instagram and liking one of his posts, a clear indication of interest.

- During a party at a friend’s house, a random female's behavior became peculiar. While Alex was on the deck, a loud, staged scream emanated from the woods, seemingly orchestrated to capture his attention. Her indirect involvement in such an incident points to an attempt to manipulate Alex's emotions and create a sense of intrigue.

- A particularly manipulative incident occurred at another social gathering, where this female engaged in intense physical affection with Alex, only to abruptly leave without further interaction. This behavior, characterized by a sudden and extreme show of interest followed by an immediate withdrawal, is indicative of classic "love-bombing" tactics designed to elicit strong emotional responses, only to then undermine them through detachment.

- Further manipulation is evident in the summer of 2014 when this female stayed at Alex’s parents’ house for two consecutive nights. After engaging in what appeared to be normal social interaction, including a morning coffee run, she ceased communication entirely. This abrupt cessation led to a severe emotional reaction from Alex, who, in his frustration, caused property damage, resulting in a police intervention. Such actions demonstrate her pattern of drawing in her target, fostering emotional dependency, and then withdrawing, causing emotional harm.

- In 2015, her employment at [REDACTED], coinciding with Alex’s period of homelessness, further illustrates her manipulative tendencies. Her presence at the store, whether coincidental or intentional, positioned her in a space where she could observe Alex without direct engagement, perpetuating a sense of inaccessibility and control over their interactions.

Overall, this female’s behavior demonstrates a clear pattern of social manipulation directed towards Alex, aimed at gaining attraction through strategic engagement and presence, only to subsequently withdraw and dump the attraction, resulting in emotional distress and confusion for him. This pattern suggests a calculated approach to creating and then destabilizing emotional connections for personal gratification or influence.

### Additional Female Involvement Notes

- The female might be attempting to exploit the familiarity heuristic by using a familiar name as his relatives. By having a name similar to his relatives, she may hope to create an immediate sense of comfort and familiarity.

- The female might have been trying to position herself in my environment or social circles, either intentionally or coincidentally.

### Continued Timeline

In 2015, Alex's legal challenges continued with an arrest for harassment by his ex-girlfriend from public school, resulting in a three-year peace bond. During this period, Alex also sought help for his mental health issues by submitting himself to the [REDACTED] in late 2015. Despite these efforts, his interactions with law enforcement were ongoing, leading to further complications. In 2016, he was charged with criminal harassment and placed on another peace bond. His legal representation at the time failed to address his mental health needs adequately, exacerbating his situation.

From 2017 to 2019, Alex's legal troubles intensified with multiple incidents involving harassment charges, dangerous driving, and social media threats. In 2019, he was arrested for dangerous driving and disobeying a court order. Later that year, he faced charges for posting threatening comments online, which led to his arrest on a weekend. This timing appeared intentional, as it resulted in Alex being held in jail, where he was assaulted and sustained a broken nose. Throughout these years, Alex felt that his mental health issues were not adequately considered by his legal representation or the judicial system.

In 2020 and 2021, Alex continued to face legal challenges and complaints regarding police conduct and inadequate mental health support from a doctor. He also experienced harassment from various individuals, which complicated his legal situation further. Despite reaching out to authorities, many of his complaints were ignored or dismissed. Notably, a fire at the police property storage building in 2022 destroyed personal property seized from Alex in 2019, leading to further frustration and unanswered questions regarding the incident's investigation and his potential compensation.

### Additional Information

- Alex now faces financial difficulties, including the need for a $15000 CAD nose job due to injuries sustained in jail. Despite his efforts to seek justice and proper legal defense, Alex's interactions with the legal system continued to reflect a lack of adequate support and resolution for his numerous grievances.

### Imitating Females knows to Mental Health Patient

During his treatment at Lakeridge Health, Alex was reportedly subjected to behavior by staff members that closely resembled the manipulative tactics employed by a female who had previously targeted him. This included instances of engaging in friendly and supportive interactions, followed by abrupt withdrawal and disengagement, mirroring the pattern of attraction and rejection that Alex had experienced before. Such behavior could be perceived as re-traumatizing, undermining Alex's sense of trust and security within the healthcare environment.

The imitation of these behaviors by healthcare professionals is deeply concerning, as it may have intensified Alex's emotional vulnerability and impaired his ability to engage effectively with the therapeutic process. The deliberate mimicry of a manipulative individual’s behavior by staff, whether intentional or inadvertent, suggests a lack of sensitivity and professional judgment. It raises serious ethical questions about the appropriateness of their conduct and the impact it may have had on Alex’s mental health.

These actions, if verified, represent a significant breach of professional standards and could indicate a misuse of authority within a therapeutic setting. Such behavior not only contradicts the principles of patient-centered care but also poses a risk of further psychological harm to the patient.
