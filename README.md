### Talking Theory

Engaging in a conversation with Alex from Sourceduty offers an opportunity to explore a wide range of topics, given his dynamic involvement in digital design, 3D modeling, and the open-source community. One fruitful area to discuss could be the potential for integrating Sourceduty’s 3D model portfolio into emerging sectors like virtual reality and augmented reality. This would not only open new avenues for creative expression but also position Sourceduty as a pioneer in the VR/AR design space, aligning with the industry's trend towards immersive experiences. Another intriguing topic could be the intersection of AI and digital art, exploring how generative models, such as GPT, can complement traditional 3D workflows or create entirely new forms of interactive digital content. This dialogue could spark ideas on innovative projects or collaborations that leverage both Sourceduty’s technical assets and Alex's artistic vision.

Delving into vocations, Alex’s multifaceted skills and the company's unique asset base make him well-suited to roles such as a Creative Technologist or a Digital Innovation Strategist. These positions would allow him to bridge the gap between creative design and cutting-edge technology, driving forward projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in digital art and technology integration. Additionally, Alex’s passion for open-source development and community engagement could translate well into a thought leadership role within the open-source ecosystem, where he could champion sustainable and ethical practices in digital creation. This would not only amplify Sourceduty’s impact but also foster a community of like-minded creators and technologists around the company’s vision and values.
