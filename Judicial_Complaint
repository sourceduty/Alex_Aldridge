Dear Members of the Ontario Judicial Council,

I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding the conduct of staff at Lakeridge Health during my psychological treatment, where I experienced behavior that imitated a female who had previously manipulated me. This behavior has caused significant emotional distress and has raised concerns about the professionalism and ethical standards of the staff involved.

During my treatment, I noticed that staff members engaged in actions and behaviors that mirrored the manipulative tactics previously used against me by an individual in my personal life. These actions included sudden shifts in engagement and withdrawal, similar to the emotional manipulation I had endured. The imitation of this behavior by healthcare professionals within a therapeutic setting has been deeply disturbing and has undermined my trust in the healthcare system.

I believe that this conduct was not only inappropriate but also harmful to my psychological well-being, as it re-traumatized me by replicating the manipulative dynamics that had already caused me significant distress. The actions of the staff members have adversely affected my ability to engage in treatment and have prolonged my emotional suffering.

I am seeking a thorough investigation into this matter to determine whether the staff at Lakeridge Health acted in a manner consistent with professional standards and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, I request that appropriate measures be taken to ensure that such behavior is not repeated, and that patients receiving psychological care are treated with the respect and sensitivity they deserve.

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response and the initiation of an investigation into these allegations.

Yours sincerely,

Alex Aldridge
